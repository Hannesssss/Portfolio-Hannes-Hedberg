## Empire at War Expanded (EAWX) :star:


<img src="assets/fleet.gif" alt="Coding man" width="100%" height="20%" />

"Palpatine's machinations and the decay of the Republic have brought the galaxy into the most destructive war it's ever seen. The Separatist droid armies threaten to overrun the Republic and no matter who comes out on top, the course of galactic history will be altered forever..."

One of the larger projects im apart of is large mod for Star Wars Empire at War [^2] by Petroglyph Games [^1] . Since updates for the game stopped more than 10 years ago its been up to the modders to keep the game fresh. With over 500 000 steam subcribers and countless more downloads from Modb its safe to say that EAWX is responsible for some of the most popular mods for this old game. 

I have personally been part of the team for nearly 3 years now, and along with a team of roughly 30 modders we strive to mod Empire at war to make the best star wars strategy game on the market. Personally i have been a Sound Engineer for the team, wheter it being brand new sounds and voices or importing something from a show or movie i have contributed with thousands of sound files for the mods. Other than that i also worked closley with one of the teams animators to create the trailer you can see above, i also have my own cinematic currently under production but as of yet far from being finished.

EAWX has a large community with over 10 000+ members on our discord, intrested to see for yourself? Here is an invite link just for you: [^5]

This is the mod i have personally had most work done in.                               |
