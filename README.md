## Bilvision - First Internship &#128663;
<img src="assets/bilvision.png" alt="Bilvision Banner"/>

### Internship Full Description 

<details>
  <summary><b>Click to Expand</b></summary>
  
During my 8-week tenure at Bilvision, I worked as a Data Scientist. Bilvision utilizes Microsoft Database Manager for its organizational needs. They encountered numerous time-consuming and repetitive tasks within their workflow, prompting the need for machine learning solutions to automate and expedite processes. Their database contained an extensive collection of approximately 32 million vehicles. While a substantial portion of the data included accurate labels for brands and models, a significant amount of information remained concealed within unstructured text strings.

To address this challenge, I developed and trained a model using Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on Named Entity Recognition (NER). I created two distinct models; one was designed to identify car brands mentioned in text, and the other was responsible for locating references to car models. The results of these models were stored in separate columns for further processing. Additionally, I implemented an Auto-spelling program, which incorporated the Levenshtein distance algorithm to determine the closest possible matches for misspelled words. This spelling verification process was further enhanced by utilizing a Python package for sound analysis. The package could vocalize words and compare the pronunciation to known correct forms.

When the various spelling models reached a consensus, the result was automatically accepted. In cases where discrepancies arose among the models, the system prompted the user to select one of the suggested corrections or provide a custom input. User-generated inputs were stored as reference data for subsequent spell checks. Furthermore, I integrated Active Learning techniques into the models' training process. This allowed the models to create their own training data and retrain themselves when encountering previously unseen car brands or models.

In such cases, users were prompted to enter the car brand or model mentioned within a given sentence. The input was then incorporated into randomly generated training data for the models to learn from. This dynamic approach ensures that the models can identify car brands and models in the future, even if new ones are introduced into the system.

## Empire at War Expanded (EAWX) :star:

![Empire at War Expanded](assets/fleet.gif)

> "Palpatine's machinations and the decay of the Republic have brought the galaxy into the most destructive war it's ever seen. The Separatist droid armies threaten to overrun the Republic, and no matter who comes out on top, the course of galactic history will be altered forever."

One of the significant projects I'm part of is a large mod for **Star Wars Empire at War**[^2] by **Petroglyph Games**[^1]. Since updates for the game ceased over ten years ago, modders have taken on the task of keeping the game fresh. **Empire at War Expanded (EAWX)** is responsible for some of the most popular mods for this classic game, boasting over 500,000 Steam subscribers and countless more downloads from ModDB.

### My Contribution

I've been a part of this project for nearly three years. As a Sound Engineer for the team, I've contributed thousands of sound files, including new sounds and voices. I've also imported audio assets from shows and movies. Additionally, I worked closely with one of the team's animators to create trailers and spent time teaching myself animation and video rendering. I'm currently working on my cinematic, some clips of which are featured in this portfolio.

### EAWX Community

EAWX has a vibrant community with over 10,000 members on our Discord[^5].

**Experience the Mod:**

- [Thrawn's Revenge][Ex1]: Creates a new universe based on Star Wars legends with new factions and mechanics.
- [Fall of the Republic][Ex2]: Brings players into the era of the *Clone Wars*, allowing them to maintain order as the Grand Army of the Republic or sow chaos as part of the Separatist movement. I've personally worked extensively on this mod.
- [Revan's Revenge][Ex3]: Based on the old republic, this mod explores ancient history in the Star Wars universe (not released yet).
